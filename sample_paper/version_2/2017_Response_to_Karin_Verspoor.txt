R2: There is relevant literature that is not considered here
> I've added an entire new section about related works, by citing all the papers and specifications proposed, among others.

R2: Note that the citation provided for categorial grammar is probably not the canonical/most relevant citation, see [10] inter alia.
> The citation about categorial grammar has been removed as consequence of the revision of the article.

R2: In addition, I found some of the aspects of the theory and algorithms described in section 4.1 not entirely clear. The interpretation of some of the core structural patterns as named isn't intuitive, and the notion of "coherence" that is relevant to pattern assignment is not entirely clear, especially given that every possible combination of t,s,T exists.
> I've clarified all these aspects in the revision, by adding several definitions and examples.

R2: I also wonder about the use of the term "validity" in the Conclusions. In what way could this approach (as a whole) be validated as opposed to shown to apply in particular contexts?
> I've reworded the part about the validity in the conclusions, removing the term “validity” – that was incorrect for the context, and clarifying that CISE (and its implementations) provides a partial positive answer to the research question presented in the introduction Section 1.

R2: Note there are a few typos and language usage issues.
> I've revised the whole article and corrected all the typos and grammatical mistakes I've found.

R2: I would suggest "the Semantic Publishing" should be simply "Semantic Publishing" in the title and elsewhere
> I've revised the text accordingly.
