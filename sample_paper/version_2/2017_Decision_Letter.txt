We are pleased to inform you that your paper has been accepted for publication, under the condition that you address the remaining minor issues (if any).

This substantially revised manuscript addresses many of the concerns of the reviewers, but there are still a variety of relatively minor issues that we can trust the author to address in their final version. However, greater elaboration on the "downward causation" concept is needed in order to properly communicate to the intended audience.

Please carefully take into account the enclosed comments by the reviewers when preparing the revised version. Provide point-by-point responses to the issues raised by the reviewers and prepare a separate text file that contains these responses.
