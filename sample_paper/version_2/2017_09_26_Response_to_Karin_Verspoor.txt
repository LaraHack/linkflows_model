R2: The notion of "downward causation" that has been added to the manuscript is not entirely clear and not supported by examples.

> We have added an example in order to clarify what does it means and how can be applied in the context of CISE. Examples of its application/implementation are briefly illustrated in 5.3.

R2: The definition of structural patterns is presented in terms of modal constraints ("can or cannot"); it is unclear precisely how these constraints can be inferred from examples. (Should it be "do or do not"?)

> The constraints introduced in the pattern theory presented in the article have been derived by several studies people in my research group have done in the past on XML grammars and documents, in particular [43]. I've added a reference and a brief sentence to explain this aspect.

R2: The code the defines mapping from structural patterns to structural semantics is underspecified and seems largely to depend on heuristics. Is there a strategy for evaluating such heuristics or validating the assumptions that they are based on?

> Each rule that defines the mapping between structural patterns and structural semantics is implemented by some heuristics that have been derived by analysing how the structural patterns are used in scholarly documents, as discussed in [10] with more details. I've added a paragraph for describing this with more details, that is also accompanied by an example for identifying paragraphs. As already mentioned in the revision, the annotations on a large set of documents, that result from these mappings, have been compared, via precision and recall, with a gold standard we have created by assigning structural characterizations to all the markup elements defined in DocBook.

R2: There is somewhat of a normative feel to several of the comments in the paper -- e.g. the discussion of HTML in Section 6. Saying that certain behaviour "should be avoided" doesn't change the fact that people will do it anyway, usually because they don't realise that there might be a different way of doing things, or have reasons to prefer that other way. If you are going to argue that there are consensus patterns that can be inferred from examples, then you should acknowledge that those patterns might vary from some ideal.

> People are using such flat organisation since it is simpler to implement (in particular in tools) and/or to write by hand. However, as mentioned in the paper, it does not explicitly carry the intended hierarchical organisation of the sections â€“ since no section are defined.

R2: Regarding the comment relating to validation of heuristics, there should be some discussion of how mappings between structural patterns, structural semantics, and rhetorical components are derived. Can this be automated?

> Full details of how these mappings are derived are actually presented in the related papers, i.e. [10] and [12]. In this article I've provided only the main concepts and intuitions behind the algorithms we have implemented. Honestly, I think that a full and complete discussion about these algorithms/mappings (which would be a repetition of already published articles) is out-of-scope here, and it would move the attention of the reader far from the crucial aspect of the paper, i.e. CISE. In addition, we've never used any automatic technique for identifying/creating the mapping rules. Each of the rules introduced in such papers are, in fact, the result of an accurate observation of scholarly articles according to the various layers that have been introduced/implemented.

R2: Some typos/usage issues I picked up:

"people suggest" -> "people have suggested"

"use the sole syntactic organisation" -> "use solely the syntactic organisation"

"pure syntactic organisation" (do you mean "purely the syntactic organisation"?)

"the sole containment" -> "solely the containment"

"Contrarily" -> "In contrast"

"without caring about" -> "without consideration of"

"speculate" -> "propose"

"apply iteratively" -> "iteratively apply"

"In this cases" -> "In these cases"

"all the individual" -> "all the individual"

"experiment possible" -> "experiment with possible"

"brutal" -- strong word; probably you mean something else?

> Fixed.
