Summary of paper in a few sentences (summary of changes and improvements for second round reviews): 

This revised manuscript is completely reworked and much improved in several ways. In fact, Figure 2 and Listing 1 made me understand the basic idea of the approach, which I previously misunderstood. It is now clear that the natural language text is not processed at all and that semantic representations are built in an iterative manner starting from syntactic clues of the hierarchical structure of the document. It is indeed interesting to see how far one can get with such an approach (as demonstrated in Section 5), and I am convinced by the paper that more of this kind can be done to climb to higher layers. It is also very clear though that this won't get us to the highest possible levels of understanding the content of the text paragraphs, and thereby the details of the arguments and claims made. All types of NLP are considered out-of-scope for CISE, but it wasn't clear to me whether the rules within CISE *could* apply NLP techniques (while CISE as a framework is agnostic about languages), or whether NLP would have to happen outside of the whole CISE process because all rules need to be language-agnostic.

Reasons to accept: 

- Interesting and controversial claims (in particular that we can do semantic publishing based only on syntactic properties of scientific documents)
- Built upon an impressive collection of previous work in this area
- Addresses a highly relevant problem
- Nice examples and pseudo-code that are helpful to understand the paper's position

Reasons to reject: 

- The disregard for any kind of NLP is an important limitation by design, but it is not clear how CISE could be combined with NLP (or, alternatively, why it is beneficial to refrain from NLP altogether)

Further comments: 

- I didn't understand how higher levels effect lower levels by downward causation. The "enviroment" is a crucial part of downward causation (according to the Wikipedia definition), but I didn't understand what this environment is in the case of CISE, and how it allows for this type of effect. Is the environment the entire article, or even the entire socio-technical system? And how does this environment cause the lower layers to change?

- "who, not necessarily, have authored such works": I think this needs to be rephrased to be proper English.

- Parenthesis not closed: "(25th percentile 34, 75th percentile 175"

- "can the pure syntactic organisation ...": should this be "purely syntactic"?

- "restricting the possible input documents to the sole scholarly articles": I didn't understand what "sole" means in this context.

- The article introduces the term "CISE" twice: in Section 1 and Section 4. I think once is enough.

- I didn't understand this: "a layer describing a particular conceptualisation of the parts of a scholarly article is dependent somehow on the conceptualisation of at least another lower/higher layer"

- "continues until new annotations are added or removed from the current set of annotations available": Should this read "... until *no* new annotations are added ..."?

- Wouldn't the while loop of Listing 1 stop if the same number of annotations are added and removed? Shouldn't it keep running until no new annotation is added and no annotation is removed (i.e. a fixpoint is reached)?

- The fact that rules are applied to *sets* of documents (according to Listing 1) should be explained better. Are such rules therefore supposed to find common patterns across documents?

- "i.e. it is possible to use them, in principle, to write locally/globally incoherent documents": An example might be helpful here.

- "(regardless they are pattern-based or not)" > "(regardless of whether they are ..."

- I would drop "although they seem reasonable" from this sentence: "Instead, the other conditions introduced in Section 4 are less strict and need a more careful investigation, although they seem reasonable."
