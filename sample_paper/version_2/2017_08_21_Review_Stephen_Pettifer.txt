Summary of paper in a few sentences (summary of changes and improvements for second round reviews): 

The paper has been substantially revised throughout in the light of the first round of reviewer comments: the narrative is clearer and tighter; and the extent to which formalisms are introduced is more commensurate with the purpose they are used for; and there are many more concrete examples to support the author's position.

Reasons to accept: 

This is an interesting and somewhat controversial position - a decent starting point for discussion and debate in the community.

Reasons to reject: 

Even though the narrative and examples now make the author's position much clearer, I personally remain unconvinced of the argument towards automation. But that's fine -- this is a position paper, and it's an interesting position that warrants further discussion, so on that basis I'd be happy to see it published.
