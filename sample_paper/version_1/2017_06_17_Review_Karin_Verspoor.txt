Summary of paper in a few sentences: 

This opinion paper introduces the reader to a proposal for formally modelling the structure of scholarly papers, and supporting combinations of lower-level structures to imply higher-level structures. The author argues that this approach will allow automatic enrichment of documents with semantic information, based on a sort of projection from syntactic patterns to the semantics implied implied by those patterns.

Reasons to accept: 

The notion of, as I have understood it, reasoning over combinations of annotations to infer higher-order semantic types is interesting. While the discussion here focuses mostly on formal characterisation of the relationships/patterns, I can imagine that this could also be relevant to empirically derived models, e.g. statistical models derived from data mining/machine learning over semantic features. The author's comment that a majority of authors follow consistent patterns does not surprise me and I agree could be leveraged (whether rule-based or statistical) for compliance checks or feedback purposes. It makes sense to think of the structure of documents as compositional and the approach outlined here enables that.

There is pragmatic value in the approach; to the extent that semantic characteristics can be inferred from a document itself rather than demanding additional manual effort, the more likely those characteristics will be captured and represented.

Reasons to reject: 

There is relevant literature that is not considered here, including the role of writing assistants for semantic enrichment [1] as well as the literature on web annotation and provenance from various W3C communities [2]-[3] and indeed the linguistic annotation communities (which often use stand-off annotation) [9]. Some work on compositionality in such models also exists [4]. The authors further mention "several tools that have been developed for addressing the automatic annotation..." without providing any details or references. I note that there is substantial work on issues such as document zoning [5] and rhetorical structure [6] and even citation analysis [7-8]. Finally the more recent and less well-developed writing of Robert Allen may be relevant [11]. While perhaps these don't (all) address the author's desire for the analysis to be independent of the language of the document content, and may not be amenable to algorithmic processing, they are certainly relevant to the broader context and argumentation -- at least for understanding how the proposals here differ.

Note that the citation provided for categorial grammar is probably not the canonical/most relevant citation, see [10] inter alia.

In addition, I found some of the aspects of the theory and algorithms described in section 4.1 not entirely clear. The interpretation of some of the core structural patterns as named isn't intuitive, and the notion of "coherence" that is relevant to pattern assignment is not entirely clear, especially given that every possible combination of t,s,T exists.

Regarding the point related to syntactical visualisation -- is this about generalisation of the patterns from a few examples? I would see this less as "compliance" (implying guidelines exist that are expected to be followed) and more as conventions that exist.

I also wonder about the use of the term "validity" in the Conclusions. In what way could this approach (as a whole) be validated as opposed to shown to apply in particular contexts?

Further comments: 

Note there are a few typos and language usage issues. I would suggest "the Semantic Publishing" should be simply "Semantic Publishing" in the title and elsewhere.
Others (not exhaustive)
Montegue -> Montague
dependent -> dependant
"for automatically generate" -> "to automatically generate"
What is "a rhetoric/rhetorics" (i.e. as a noun)?
What is an "easily complex" operation?
Reconsider use of "actually" in Abstract (can be safely removed)
