We inform you that the acceptance or rejection of your manuscript is still UNDECIDED (we don't use "major revisions" or "minor revisions").

The manuscript presents an important idea that needs to be further developed to be acceptable for publication. In particular, the authors should address concerns about the unnecessarily complex and unconvincing argumentation, the lack of relevant literature, and the need to discuss assumptions and limitations.

We ask you to provide a revised version by carefully taking into account the enclosed comments by the reviewers. Please provide point-by-point responses to the issues raised by the reviewers and prepare a separate text file that contains these responses. By submitting this point-by-point response you agree that it will be made public on the journal website under the same license as the reviews, which is CC-BY (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

The revised version of the paper is expected within 20 days. Your revised version might be sent to the reviewers again, and afterward a final decision is made. There won't be a third round. You should mention the tracking number of this paper when you upload a new version.
