One of the pioneers of this kind of grammars, i.e. Richard Montague, in one of his seminal works [12], claimed that there is no difference, at least from a theoretical point of view, between natural languages and logic languages. The consequence of this observation is that it is possible to use precise mathematical tools for defining both the syntax and the semantics of any natural language (e.g. English) in the same way logicians usually do for their artificial languages.
