Intuitively, following the sketch illustrated in Figure 1, starting from a low-level definition of the structure of an article, e.g. the organisation of the XML elements that have been used to describe its content (layer 1), it is possible to create rules that describe each XML element according to more general compositional patterns depicting its structures that oblige a specific implicit and unmentioned organisation of the article content (layer 2) â€“ e.g. the fact that there an element can behaves like a block or an inline item. Again, starting from the definitions in the first two layers, it would be possible to characterise the semantics of each XML element according to fixed categories defining its structural behaviour, e.g. paragraph, section, table, figure, etc. (layer 3). Along the same lines, starting from the aforementioned layers, it would be possible to derive the rhetorical organisation of a scholarly paper, e.g. identifying the argumentative role of each section introduced in such paper such as introduction, methods, material, experiment, data, results, conclusions, etc. (layer 4). And so on and so forth.
