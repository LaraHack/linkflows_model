The approach proposed by Curry and Howard, and then its application in the Linguistics domain introduced by Montague, can be seen from a more general point of view. We are not obliged to take in consideration only natural languages, but rather we can use two independent formalisms (languages, in the broad term) and to define compositional rules that can relate one to each other. Given this premise, the intuition is that we can, in principle, apply iterative transformations starting from the pure syntactical organisation of the various components of a scholarly document (i.e. the elements expressed in a particular markup language, e.g. an XML-based language, and how they contain each other by analysing existing documents) so as to derive their structural semantics (paragraphs, sections, figures, etc.) and, then, their rhetorics (introductions, methods, material, results, conclusions, etc.), and other semantic representations of document components. The idea is that each of these syntactic/structural/semantic aspects, that we would like to arise starting from a pure syntactic organisation of document markup, can be defined in fact as standalone languages (e.g. by means of ontologies) with their proper compositional rules and functions.
