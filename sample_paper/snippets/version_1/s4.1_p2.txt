The two main aspects related to such patterns are:

orthogonality – each pattern has a specific goal and fits a specific context. It makes it possible to associate a single pattern to each of the most common situations in document design. Conversely, for every situation a designer encounters in the creation of a new markup language, the corresponding pattern is immediately selectable and applicable;

assemblability – each pattern can be used only in some contexts within other patterns. This strictness provides expressiveness and non-ambiguity in the patterns. By limiting the possible choices, patterns prevent the creation of uncontrolled and misleading content structures.
