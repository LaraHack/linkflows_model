Of course, the aforementioned applications of the Montegue's approach are strictly related to the natural language text of the content one has to analyse. In fact, all the syntax-to-semantics mappings are strictly dependant on a specific language, mainly English, and thus they can be used only when one is sure to analyse documents written in such language. However, one of the goal of the approach I am envisioning in this article has a specific premise: that the language in which a scholarly document (e.g. a journal article) is written should not be a constraint for the application of automatic mechanisms for deriving semantics from texts.
