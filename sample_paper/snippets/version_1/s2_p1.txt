The Curry-Howard isomorphism [10] is a principle saying that two different formalisms, i.e. the proof system and the model of computation (such as the lambda calculus), are actually the same mathematical tool presented from two different perspectives. The basic idea introduced by this isomorphism is that mathematical proofs can be written as computer programs and, thus, these proofs can be run, and vice versa. This approach has been very relevant for the Computer Science domain, since it allowed researchers to start to investigate new research fields such as type theory, and to create new programming languages for implementing such isomorphism by design, such as Coq.
