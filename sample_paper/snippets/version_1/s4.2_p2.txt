Starting from these premises, the algorithm described in a work I was involved in [23] aims at proposing a new algorithm for implementing the transition between layer 2 and layer 3 as sketched above. The experiment introduced in this work involved all the documents of a specific community, i.e. the XML sources of all the papers published in the Proceedings of Balisage (http://balisage.net) encoded in DocBook format [21], that have been already used in the algorithm introduced in Section 4.1. Thus, starting from the outcomes of the aforementioned algorithm, colleagues and I have defined additional rules so as to retrieve the actual structural semantics of XML elements (paragraph, section, figure, table, figure box, table box, bibliography, bibliographic reference, footnote, etc.) by simply looking at the structural patterns that have been assigned to them. The Document Components Ontology (DoCO) [16] has been used for annotating the elements of all the (pattern-based and non-pattern-based) documents with the appropriate semantic structure.
