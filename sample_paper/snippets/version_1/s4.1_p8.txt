It is worth mentioning that, once the algorithm has identified that all the elements X in pattern-based documents of a certain community comply with a particular pattern, then it is possible to implicitly associate the same pattern also to all the elements X contained in non-pattern-based documents of the same community. As a consequence, these assignments can also provide a guide to authors (or even to automatic tools) for adjusting the current organisation of non-pattern-based documents so as to convert them in proper pattern-based ones.
