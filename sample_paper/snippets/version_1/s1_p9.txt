The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 I introduce the foundational theories that have been used to derive the approach for automating the enhancement of scholarly articles. In Section 3 I introduce CISE by describing its main hypotheses and its potential applications. In Section 4 I briefly discuss the outcomes of some experiments that implement the first steps of a larger proposal for a CISE-like workflow for enriching scholarly articles stored in XML formats, and I present future directions of research I will investigate. Finally, in Section 5 I conclude the paper.
