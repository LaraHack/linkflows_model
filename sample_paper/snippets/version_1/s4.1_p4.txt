By combining all these possible values – i.e. ±t, ±s, and ±T – we basically obtain eight core structural patterns (described in the Pattern Ontology), namely:

inline [+t+s+T];

block [+t+s-T];

popup [-t+s+T];

container [-t+s-T];

atom [+t-s+T];

field [+t-s-T];

milestone [-t-s+T];

meta [-t-s-T].
