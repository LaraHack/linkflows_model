Semantic Publishing concerns the use of Web and Semantic Web technologies and standards for enhancing a scholarly work semantically (by means of plain RDF statements [2], nano-publications [3], etc.) so as to improve its discoverability, interactivity, openness and (re-)usability for both humans and machines [4] â€“ something which is very close to the recent proposal of the FAIR principles for scholarly data [6]. First examples of Semantic Publishing regarded the use of manual (e.g. [5]) or (semi-)automatic processes (e.g. [7]) for enriching scholarly works with formal semantics after their publication, and by people who, not necessarily, have authored such works.
