Implementations of CISE would allow us to study intra- and inter-domain patterns and similarities that exist between scholarly documents at large. In particular, one of the main aims is to identify which particular structures and semantical connotations are share among different research areas, and how much argumentative information is actually hidden behind quite simple syntactic structures. From such analysis, we could also identifying particular organisation of document components that would allow us to clearly identify paper as belonging to a certain domain, the types of papers (research paper, review, letter, etc.), and other possible ways of discriminating and organising them in clusters sharing similar features. In the next section I introduce first evidences derived by a particular implementation of CISE I have developed with other colleagues in my research group, so as to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.
