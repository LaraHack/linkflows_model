I have also discussed some of the outcomes of past experimentations that implement the first steps of a CISE-like workflow that colleagues and I have introduced for enabling the automatic annotation of document components in scholarly papers according to particular structural patterns (inline, block, etc.) and, then, structural semantics (paragraph, section, figure, etc.). Even if these experiments are not an undebatable proof of the validity of CISE, they can be considered first sketches, which suggest that CISE has a quite good margin of being feasibly implemented.
