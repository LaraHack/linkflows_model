The basic principle that would grant the feasibility of this approach is that, while scholarly documents can be written in different natural languages, the main constituents they contain are in fact shared among the whole scholarly communication domain. Of course the way of presenting a research can vary according to the particular research area we are considering â€“ e.g. Life Sciences papers usually follow a well-defined structure, while Computer Science papers are usually organised in a less conservative way. However, I think that, since we are dealing with research works at large, all these kinds of papers are following generic underlying ways of organising the arguments supporting a research. My hypothesis is that such ways are shared somehow between the various research areas.
