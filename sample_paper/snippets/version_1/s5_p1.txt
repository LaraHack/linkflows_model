In this paper I have introduced the compositional and iterative semantic enhancement (CISE) approach for enriching scholarly papers with meaningful semantic annotations by means of Semantic Publishing technologies. Taking inspiration from existing theories in the Theoretical Computer Science domain, CISE depicts a strategy for developing and implementing a mechanism that enables the automatic enhancement of scholarly papers by means of an iterative process composed by several steps, which builds on the idea of providing additional semantic connotations of document components in a scholarly paper by combining the enhancements already obtained as outcomes of previous steps.
