In recent years, I have experimented extensively, with other colleagues in my research group, with possible paths for the implementation of CISE. Our goal, starting from the pure syntactic containment of the various parts comprising scholarly articles, was to derive additional semantic descriptions of them. Each implementation of CISE we developed aimed at inferring new annotations related to one layer only, describing a specific kind of information.
