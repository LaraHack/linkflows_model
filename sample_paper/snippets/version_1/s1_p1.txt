The scholarly communication domain has been involved in several revolutions concerning the way scientific knowledge has been shared in the past 300 years. Guttemberg's introduction of the print (around 1450) together with the creation of formally-defined groups of scholars (e.g. the Royal Society founded in 1660) have permitted research works to be shared according to a well-known medium, i.e. print volumes. Notable examples of this era are Philosophical Transactions published by the Royal Society (first issued in 1776, and still available for submissions) and The Lancet (first issued in 1823, and currently published by Elsevier). Nothing actually changed in such domain until the introduction of the Internet (considering ARPANET as its first implementation around 1960), where communicating research results could happen in a very fast and effective way by means of e-mails. However, the actual first revolution in scholarly communication, since the introduction of the Guttemberg's printer, happened with the advent of the World Wide Web, or WWW, in 1989. The WWW has permitted the explosion of the Digital Publishing, i.e. the use of digital formats for the publication (e.g. PDF) and distribution (e.g. the Web) of scholarly works. In the last twenty years, the availability of new Web technologies and the reduction of the cost for storage have resulted in an incredible growth in terms of the scholarly material available online and in a consequent acceleration of the publishing workflow. However, it is with the advent of one specific set of Web technologies, i.e. Semantic Web technologies [1], that we have started to talk about Semantic Publishing.
