The systematic use of the patterns introduced in Section 4.1 allows authors to create unambiguous, manageable and well-structured documents. In addition, thanks to the regularity they provide, it is possible to perform easily complex operations on pattern-based documents even when knowing very little about their vocabulary. Thus, the intuition is that it is possible to implement more reliable and efficient tools and algorithms that can make hypotheses regarding the meanings of document fragments, that can identify singularities and, that can study global properties of sets of documents.
