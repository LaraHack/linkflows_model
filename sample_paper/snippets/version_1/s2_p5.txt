Summarising: by applying the Curry-Howard isomorphism in the categorial grammars, it is possible to define the syntax of a natural language in a way that is able to carry the semantic interpretations of the various constituents of that language at the same time. In other words, it is possible to obtain the meaning of a sentence (defined by logic formulas) by analysing only its syntactic composition. It is worth mentioning that this approach is not merely theoretical, but rather it has been implemented by Computational Linguistics researchers, e.g. in Boxer [13], and it has been already applied in real case scenarios in the Semantic Web domain, e.g. in FRED [9].
