In particular, in his work, Montague used the principle of compositionality, which states that the meaning of a complex object or expression is determined by the meanings of its constituents plus the rules that have been used to combine them. By applying this principle, Montague defined an approach, called Montague grammar, that allows the definition of a precise syntax of a language by means of a set of atomic syntactic categories – such as noun, nominal phrase, propositional phrase, etc. – that can be combined for creating more complex categories by means of specific operators. In addition, this approach allows one to provide a possible semantic representation of each syntactic category by using formulas expressed in lambda calculus. Thus, the idea is that, if we have a language defined by using the Montague grammar, we can write sentences that are syntactically correct and, by means of their mapping, we also can derive their meaning expressed as logic formulas.
