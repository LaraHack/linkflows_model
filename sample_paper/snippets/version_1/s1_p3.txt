The misalignment between who authored the original work and who added semantic annotations upon it is the focal point discussed by the editors-in-chief of this journal in this introductory issue. Their point is that, after having experimented with the Semantic Publishing, we should start to push and support what they call Genuine Semantic Publishing. This genuineness basically refers to the fact that the semantic enhancement of a scholarly work should be actually done by the authors of that scholarly work and it should be included in it since the beginning. According to this perspective, the semantic annotations the scholarly work includes should be considered as proper part of the contribution and treated as such (e.g. reviewed properly).
