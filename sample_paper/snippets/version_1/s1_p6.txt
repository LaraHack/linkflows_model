The identification of which dimension to consider for extracting semantic annotations from a scholarly work is subjective. For instance, one can consider more important to have all the citations in a paper described according to their functions (i.e. the reasons why an author has cited other works), while others can consider more functional to have a formal description of the main argumentative claim of the paper with its evidences. In the past years several tools have been developed for addressing the automatic annotation of scholarly texts according to one or more particular dimensions. However, this kind of approaches is typically tied to specific requirements, e.g. the use of a specific markup and/or a particular language used for organising and writing the content, that prevent it from being used in broader contexts. The idea is that the aforementioned approaches can work correctly only if used with documents stored in a particular format, such as the SPAR Extractor Suite developed for the RASH format [8], and/or if the text to process is written in a particular language such as English, as happens for FRED [9].
