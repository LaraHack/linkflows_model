While the Genuine Semantic Publishing is, indeed, the right way to consider the question, it still needs specific incentives for convincing the authors to spend more time on semantically enriching their articles in addition to all the textual content they have already written. In recent experiments colleagues and I have done in the context of the SAVE-SD workshops, described in [8], the clear trend is that, beside a few who actually believe in the Semantic Publishing and even if we made available appropriate incentives (i.e. prizes) for people submitting HTML+RDF scholarly papers, generally only a very low number of semantic statements (if none at all) is specified by the authors. Possible reasons for this behaviour could be the lack of appropriate support (e.g. graphical user interfaces) for facilitating the authors in the annotation of scholarly works with semantic data.
