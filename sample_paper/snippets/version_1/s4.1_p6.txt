The overall process described by the algorithm works as follows. First, it associates an initial structural pattern to each element included in each document available, trying to achieve in-document local coherency of the various pattern assignments according to specific composition rules defined in accordance with the aforementioned pattern theory. Then, the algorithm tries to achieve global coherency between all the XML sources written according to the same markup model. If this is not possible it stops prompting the user to identify possible partitions of the dataset.
