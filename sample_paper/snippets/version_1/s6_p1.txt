In Section 5 I have shown how the approach proposed in Section 4 can be implemented to return annotations belonging the first four layers introduced in Section 3. It also presents some issues that cannot be addressed by looking only at the syntactical containment of article parts. The most important issue is this: since CISE focusses on article parts that must be clearly marked-up in some way, all the other portions of the article text are simply discarded. By design, CISE does not undertake the analysis of natural language text. There are several existing applications, such as Named Entity Recognition tools (NER) [15] and other NLP technologies (e.g. [34]), that can be used for this purpose.
