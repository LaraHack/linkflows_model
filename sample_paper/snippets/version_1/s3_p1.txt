Taking inspiration from the ideas introduced in Section 2, the intuition is that, restricting the possible inputs to the sole scholarly papers available in a reasonable and structured markup language (e.g. XML), it is possible to implement a mechanism that can retrieve additional high-level semantic connotations of scholarly papers components starting from their specific low-level conceptualisations. This approach, I have named as compositional and iterative semantic enhancement (CISE) of scholarly articles, is thus based on the following general hypotheses:

[hierarchical markup] the sources of the scholarly article are available according to (or can be easily converted into) a document markup language that is appropriate for conveying the typical hierarchical containment proper to scholarly documents (e.g. body > section > paragraph);

[language agnosticism] there is no need of having a prior knowledge about the particular natural language used for writing the scholarly article;

[layer interdependency] a layer describing a particular conceptualisation of the components of scholarly documents is dependent somehow on the conceptualisation of at least another lower- or higher-level layer;

[inter-domain reuse] several of the structural and semantic aspects typically described in scholarly articles are shared across various research domains;

[intra-domain reuse] scholarly documents of a specific domain always share several structural and semantic aspects between them, even if such aspects are not implicitly adopted by other external domains.
