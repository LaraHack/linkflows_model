However, I do not think that this is even the main issue that prevents a huge mass of authors from enhancing their papers with semantic annotations. I firmly believe that the main bottleneck for a concrete adoption of Genuine Semantic Publishing principles is author's available time. While interfaces may simplify the creation of such semantic data, an author should always spend additional time and effort for actually creating them, and often she does not have that time available. Thus, the most pragmatic way to convince authors in doing this additional job is not to have incentives such us prizes, but rather to have services that do it for them in an automatic fashion by parsing somehow the content that the authors have already written, thus by reducing the entire time spent by them to few clicks for adding the semantic annotations.
