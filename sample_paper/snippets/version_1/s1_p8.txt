In this paper we propose a generic approach called compositional and iterative semantic enhancement, a.k.a. CISE (pronounced like size) that complies with the aforementioned requirements, which has been inspired by a well-known theoretical Computer Science technique called Curry-Howard isomorphism [10] and by the principle of compositionality proper to mathematics, semantics, and philosophy of language. The idea behind CISE is that it is possible to develop and implement a mechanism that enables the automatic enhancement of scholarly papers – independently from the markup used for storing them and the natural language used for writing their content – by means of an iterative process composed by several steps, where each step is responsible for providing additional semantic connotations of the document components included in such scholarly papers by combining the enhancements obtained as outcomes of the previous steps according to precise rules. While a undebatable proof of the validity of CISE has not been provided yet, some experiments have been run in the past and, according to their outcomes, they suggest that the approach proposed in this article can be implemented with a good margin of success.
