The pathway for implementing the whole layers of the CISE approach introduced at the beginning of Section 4 is far from being completed, and additional studies and tests are needed for having more robust outcomes. However, I think that the first experiments performed and described in Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 are acceptable pointers for claiming that the automatic semantic enhancement of scholarly articles by means of Semantic Publishing technologies is possible to some extent, even in presence of specific constraints such as the independency from the natural language used for writing such articles and the markup language used for storing their contents.
