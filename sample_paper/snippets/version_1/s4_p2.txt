The identification of all the information related to the aforementioned layers, while their description could seem easily understandable, is a quite complex work of analysis and derivation and, thus, it is far from being simple and finished. However, in the past six years, colleagues and I have experimented implementations of the aforementioned approach, and we have defined successful pathways for getting from layer 1 to layer 3. From my perspective, these works (described in the following subsections) are clear evidences that the whole implementation of CISE is indeed possible and its principles are valid, at least to certain extend, and that the automatic enhancement of scholarly articles by means of Semantic Publishing technologies can be reached without necessarily using tools that rely on natural language prerequisites or specific markup constructs.
