In the past years I have experimented extensively, with other colleagues in my research group, possible paths for implementing the approach depicted by CISE. Our goal has been to start from a very simplistic description of scholarly articles, mainly related with the pure syntactic organisation of their XML elements, so as to derive more complex semantics by means of an iterative process. In particular, our aims is to retrieve, as outcome of every step of the process, a new layer of semantical conceptualisations of document constituents according to the following scale – from most low-level and pure syntactic description of scholarly articles to their argumentative organisation, where the particular language of each layer is implemented by one specific OWL ontology:

syntactic containment (ontology: EARMARK [14]) – describing the dominance and containment relations [19] that exist between the various elements and attributes included in the XML sources of scholarly articles (e.g. the fact that a certain element X is contained in another element Y);

syntactic structures (ontology: Pattern Ontology [15]) – starting from the previous layer, inferring the particular structural pattern to which each XML element is compliant with (e.g. the fact that all the elements X behave as inline elements, while the elements Y behave as blocks);

structural semantics (ontology: DoCO [16]) – using the particular pattern-element specification provided by the previous layer, extrapolating general rules for the pattern-based composition of article structures (e.g. sections, paragraphs, tables, figures);

rhetorical components (ontology: DEO [16]) – by means of the organisation of the structural components obtained in the previous layer, inferring their rhetorical functions, so as to clearly characterise sections with a specific behaviour (e.g. introduction, methods, material, data, results, conclusions);

citation functions (ontology: CiTO [17]) – using the outcomes of the previous two layers, assigning the appropriate citation function to each occurrence of a citation in a scholarly articles (e.g. by specifying the function uses method in for all the citations included in the method section);

argumentative organisation (ontology: AMO) – analysing the various semantic characterisation of the previous layers, creating relations among the various components of scholarly articles by using specific argumentative models such as Toulmin's [20];

article categorisation (ontology: FaBiO [17]) – by looking to the ways document components are organised structurally and argumentatively, annotating each scholarly paper with the appropriate type (e.g. research paper, journal article, review, conference paper, demonstration paper, poster, opinion, report);

discipline clustering (ontology: DBpedia Ontology [18]) – understanding to which scholarly discipline each paper belong to by looking at the various characterisations that have been associated to each paper in the previous layers.
