In order to prove the applicability of CISE, and thus to provide a partial answer to the aforementioned research question, my colleagues and I have implemented and run some CISE-based algorithms, which enable us to annotate various components of scholarly articles with information about their syntactic and semantic structures and basic rhetorical purposes. To do this, we use a collection of ontologies that form a kind of hierarchy that can be used to annotate different aspects a publication – i.e. syntactic containment, syntactic structure, structural semantics, and rhetorical components – with semantic statements. The outcomes of using these CISE-based algorithms are encouraging, and seem to suggest the feasibility of the whole approach.
