Several other works have introduced theories and algorithms for the identification of various characterizations of scholarly articles, such as entities cited in articles (e.g. [13]), rhetorical structures (e.g. [24]), arguments (e.g. [34]), and citation functions (e.g. [8,40] and [19]). In addition, models and ontologies have been proposed for creating and associating annotations to documents and their parts, e.g. [4,28,33], and [25].
