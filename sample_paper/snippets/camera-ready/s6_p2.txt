CISE is intrinsically limited by some of the conditions, introduced in Section 4, necessary for its implementation. The most limiting is the requirement that the article to be analysed should be appropriately marked up by means of some (e.g. XML-based) markup language. While it is not necessary to know the particular grammar and vocabulary of the markup language used, it is crucial that the article parts are organised hierarchically according to appropriate containment principles. For instance, in an HTML-based article, all the section-subsection relations should be explicitly defined by means of nested section elements. The common usage of headings of different levels (i.e. h1â€“h6 elements) within a flat structure (e.g. an article element) is inadequate for this, since it does not explicitly define the intended hierarchical organisation of the sections.5
