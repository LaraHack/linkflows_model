In another work [46], Zou et al. propose a categorization of HTML elements based on two classes: inline (i.e. those that do not provide horizontal breaks in the visualisation of an HTML document) and line-break tags (i.e. the opposite of the inline class). They also have developed an algorithm that uses this categorization and a Hidden Markov Model for identifying the structural roles (title, author, affiliation, abstract, etc.) of textual fragments â€“ using a corpus of medical journal articles stored in HTML to provide examples.
