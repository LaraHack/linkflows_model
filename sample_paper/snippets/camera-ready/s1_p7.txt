This is a Document Engineering issue, rather than a pure Computational Linguistics one. Thus, an important aspect to investigate is whether one can use the syntactic organisation of the text (i.e. the way the various parts of the article are related to each other) to enable the meaningful automatic semantic annotation of the article. It is possible to abstract this view into a more generic research question: “Can the purely syntactic organisation of the various parts of a scholarly article convey something about its semantic and rhetorical representation, and to what extent?”
