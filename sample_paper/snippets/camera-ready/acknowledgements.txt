I would like to thank all the colleagues working at the Digital and Semantic Publishing Laboratory (DASPLab) – namely Angelo Di Iorio, Francesco Poggi, and Fabio Vitali – who have shared with me their time and effort on these topics. I would also like to thank the Editors-in-Chief and the reviewers of the Data Science Journal for their comments and suggestions – they have been fundamental to the improvement of the quality and the narrative of this article. Last but not least, two big thanks to my Semantic Publishing mentor and fellow, David Shotton. Some years ago, he gave me a wonderful book, “The Music of Life: Biology Beyond Genes” written by Denis Noble, that has been the primary source of inspiration for CISE. In addition, David has carefully proofread of the whole text, improving drastically the readability of this article.
