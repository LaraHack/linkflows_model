The graph on the right in Fig. 1 illustrates the simultaneous use of the principle of compositionality and that of downward causation for inferring the various meanings (at different layers) associated with the parts of a scholarly article. It admits the possibility that a layer can convey meaningful information to any of the higher or lower layers. Of course, in order to use the principles of compositionality and downward causation for inferring the characterization of the various parts of a scholarly article, it is important to clarify what are their main components – i.e. the parts of an expression, their meanings, and the functions that enable either the compositionality or downward causation between layers. In the context of scholarly articles, I define these three aspects as follows:
a part of a scholarly article is any content enclosed by a particular marker – for instance, if we consider a scholarly article stored with an XML-like markup language, each markup element defines a particular part of that scholarly article. In the example shown in Fig. 2, the empty boxes with red border, the blue-underlined strings, and the italic and strong strings are delimiting various parts of the scholarly article, represented by specific markup elements in the related XML sources;
the meaning of each part is an informative specification of the type or property characterizing that part. In the example shown in Fig. 2, the red labels with white text, as well as the pink rectangles, define specific semantics of some of the article parts;
a function is an associative rule that allows, given particular known premises, the specification of a meaning to a particular part of a scholarly article.
