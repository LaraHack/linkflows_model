Within the scholarly domain, Semantic Publishing concerns the use of Web and Semantic Web technologies and standards for enhancing a scholarly work semantically (by means of plain RDF statements [7], nano-publications [17], etc.) so as to improve its discoverability, interactivity, openness and (re-)usability for both humans and machines [35]. The assumptions of openness implicit in Semantic Publishing have been explicitly adopted for the publication of research data by the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) data principles [45]. Early examples of the semantic enrichment of scholarly works involved the use of manual (e.g. [36]) or (semi-)automatic post-publication processes (e.g. [1]) by people other than the original authors of such works.
