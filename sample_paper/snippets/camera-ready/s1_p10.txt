The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 I introduce some of the most important research works on this topic. In Section 3 I introduce the foundational theories that have been used to derive the approach for automating the enhancement of scholarly articles. In Section 4 I introduce CISE by describing the main conditions needed for running it and by explaining the algorithm defining the approach. In Section 5 I briefly discuss the results of implementing CISE on a corpus of scholarly articles stored in XML formats. In Section 6 I present some limitations of the approach, as well as future directions for my research on this subject. Finally, in Section 7 I conclude the paper, reprising the research question mentioned above.
