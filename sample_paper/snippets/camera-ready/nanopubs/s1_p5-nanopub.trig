I firmly believe that the main bottleneck preventing the concrete adoption of Genuine Semantic Publishing principles is the authors’ lack of available time. While interfaces may simplify the creation of semantic annotations, an author is still required to spend additional time and effort for this task, and often she does not have that time available. Thus, the most pragmatic method of encouraging authors to undertake this additional step is to provide services that do it for them in an automatic fashion by parsing the content that the authors have already written, thereby reducing the author’s task to one of checking these automated proposals for semantic annotations and then adding them to the document with a few clicks.""" .
