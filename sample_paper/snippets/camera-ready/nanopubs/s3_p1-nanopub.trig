		snp:snippetURI """The principle of compositionality “states that the meaning of an expression is a function of, and only of, the meanings of its parts together with the method by which those parts are combined” [30]. This definition is quite broad. In fact, it does not precisely define several aspects, such as what is a meaning, what is a function, and what is a part of an expression. Despite its vagueness, this principle has been used in works of several disciplines, such as:

Linguistics, e.g. Richard Montague, in one of his seminal works [27], proposes an approach that allows the definition of a precise syntax of a natural language (such as English) by means of a set of syntactic categories that are mapped to their possible semantic representations expressed as mathematical formulas by means of explicit conversion rules. In particular, the way the syntactic categories are combined within the syntactic structure of a sentence is used to derive its meaning;

Computer Science, e.g. the Curry–Howard isomorphism [18], which states that the proof system and the model of computation (such as the lambda calculus) are actually the same mathematical tool presented from two different perspectives. In this light, mathematical proofs can be written as runnable computer programs, and vice versa;

Molecular Biology, e.g. the reductionist approach used by Crick [6], among others, which claims that the behaviour of high-level functions of a larger biological system (e.g. an organism) can be explained by looking at the ways in which its low-level components (e.g. its genes) actually work.""" .
