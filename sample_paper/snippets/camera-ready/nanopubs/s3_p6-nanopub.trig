Starting from the pure syntactical containment of certain parts, we can derive their structural semantics, their rhetoric, and other semantic representations of the article. For instance, recalling the stratification into eight layers introduced above, it is possible to create rules that, starting from a low-level definition of the structure of an article (e.g. the organisation of the markup elements that have been used to describe its content – layer 1), permit each markup element to be defined according to more general compositional patterns depicting its structure (e.g. the fact that a markup element can behave like a block or an inline item – layer 2). Again, starting from the definitions in the first two layers, one can go on to characterize the semantics of each markup element according to specific categories defining its structural behaviour (e.g. paragraph, section, list, figure, etc. – layer 3). Along the same lines, one can further derive the rhetorical organisation of a scholarly article, identifying the argumentative role of each part: Introduction, Methods, Material, Experiment, inline reference, etc. (layer 4). In addition, as mentioned above, one can use some of the characterizations specified in layer 4 to specify more precisely the parts annotated in layer 3 (e.g. to identify the bibliography).""" .
