		c4o:hasContent """The third step (lines 9–11) is responsible for harmonising the pattern association of all the instances of the same element. For instance, it would be possible that, in the same document, two instances of an element “x” are assigned to two different patterns, e.g. atom and inline. However, occasionally, it would be possible to generalise these assignments so as to have the same pattern specified for all the instances of the same element – e.g. in the previous example, all the instances of “x” assigned to the pattern atom can be safely assigned to the pattern inline since it is more flexible, allowing the containment of both text nodes and markup elements. This operation of harmonisation, applied to all the pattern assignments of a document, aims at reaching the local coherence of the assignments (function reach_local_coherence) – i.e. the situation in which all the instances of each markup element in a document are assigned to the same pattern. It is worth mentioning that there are situations where such local coherence cannot be reached for some documents. In these cases, all their pattern assignments are removed, so as not to be processed by the following rules. In addition, this harmonisation operation can be applied to all the instances of all the markup elements contained in all the documents that have been found locally coherent. In this case, we talk about reaching the global coherence of the pattern assignments across the corpus of documents (function reach_global_coherence). Finally, the results of these associations are returned (line 13).""" .
