		c4o:hasContent """We have run the algorithm introduced in Listing 4 on the XML sources of all the articles published in the Proceedings of Balisage (http://balisage.net), which are marked up in DocBook [44]. We obtained quite high overall values of precision and recall (i.e. 0.887 and 0.890 respectively) when comparing the results of the algorithm with a gold standard we created manually by assigning structural characterizations to all the markup elements defined in DocBook. By analysing the outcomes of the algorithm execution, as illustrated in [10], we have reached the following conclusion:

only a small number of pattern-based documents, written by different authors of the same community, is needed for extracting the structural semantics of the main components of all the documents produced by that community.""" .
