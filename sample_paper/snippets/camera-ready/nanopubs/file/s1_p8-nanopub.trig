		snp:snippetURI """While I do not have a definite answer to that question, existing theories – such as the principle of compositionality [30] and the downward causation [3], which I discuss in more detail in Section 3 – seem to suggest that, under certain conditions, they can provide theoretical foundations for that question. Inspired by the way these theories have been used in several domains, I have developed a generic approach called compositional and iterative semantic enhancement, a.k.a. CISE (pronounced like size), that enables the automatic enhancement of scholarly articles solely by consideration of the containment between their components. This requires an iterative process in which each step provides additional semantic annotations to article components by applying specific rules to the enhancements generated by the previous steps.""" .
