Their point is that, following the early experimentation with Semantic Publishing, we should now start to push for and support what they call Genuine Semantic Publishing. This genuineness basically refers to the fact that the semantic enhancement of a scholarly work should be undertaken by the authors of that scholarly work at the time of writing. According to this perspective, the semantic annotations included within the scholarly work includes should be considered as proper part of the contribution and treated as such, including being subjected to proper peer review.""" .
