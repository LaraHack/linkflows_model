in a community (e.g., a conference proceedings or a journal) that uses a permissive non-pattern-based markup language, most authors nevertheless use a pattern-based subset of such language for writing their scholarly articles. This conclusion has been derived by analysing the outcomes of the algorithm execution, as illustrated in [9];

only a small number of pattern-based documents coming from different communities of authors, all stored using the same markup language, is needed for automatically generating generic visualisations for all documents stored in that markup language (regardless of whether they are pattern-based or not) included in the communities in consideration. This conclusion has been empirically demonstrated by developing a prototypical tool, called PViewer, which implements such automatic visualisation mechanism, as introduced in [9].""" .
