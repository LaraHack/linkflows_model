		snp:snippetURI """The pseudocode shown in Listing 1 introduces the main procedure of CISE. It works by taking three objects as inputs (line 1): a set of marked-up documents to process, a set of annotations referring to the various parts contained in the documents, and a list of rules responsible for inferring new annotations from the existing annotations associated with the documents. Each rule is actually a function taking two parameters as input: a set of documents and a set of annotations. A rule can be run or not run according to the current status of the inputs it receives. For instance, some existing annotations activate the application of a particular rule on a certain document, while others do not. In principle, a rule can simultaneously process more than one document in the input document set, and it could thus find common patterns across documents. The output of a rule is a tuple to_add, to_remove, that are two sets of annotations to be added to and removed from the current set of annotations.""" .
