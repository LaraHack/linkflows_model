		c4o:hasContent """This causal relationship is called downward causation [3], and it has been one of the main objections to a purely reductionist approach for the description of the composition and behaviour of a biological system. Downward causation can be defined as a converse of the principle of compositionality: higher layers of a biological system can cause changes to its lower layers. Thus, in the context of the aforementioned eight layers of scholarly articles, it would be possible, for instance, to infer new meanings for the elements annotated in layer 3 by applying the downward causation from layer 4 â€“ e.g. by explicitly marking a section as bibliography of an article (layer 3) if all the child elements that such a section contains (except its title) have been referenced somewhere within the article (layer 4).""" .
