		snp:snippetURI """CISE depends on the theoretical backgrounds introduced in Section 3, namely the principles of compositionality and downward causation. The other conditions introduced in Section 4 are less strict and need a more careful investigation. In particular, while scholarly documents can be written in different natural languages, their main constituents common across the whole scholarly communication domain. Of course, the presentation of research articles can vary according to the particular domain – e.g. Life Sciences articles usually follow a well-defined structure, while Computer Science articles are usually organised in a less conservative way. However, they all follow generic underlying ways of organising the arguments supporting the research conclusions – even if some aspects are more commonly found in one domain rather than another (e.g. Life Science articles typically have a Background section, while Computer Science articles have a Related Works section, whose function, while similar, is different in important aspects). Nevertheless, my hypothesis (partially supported by existing studies, e.g. [26]) is that many of the ways of organising research articles are shared across the various research areas.""" .
