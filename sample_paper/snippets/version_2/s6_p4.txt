Future extensions and new implementations of CISE will permit me to study such intra- and inter-domain patterns and similarities, identifying which particular structures and semantic connotations are shared between different research areas, and determining how much argumentative information is hidden behind quite simple syntactic structures. From such analysis, it might be possible to identify particular patterns of organisation of document parts that characterize certain domains or particular the types of papers (research papers, reviews, letters, etc.).
