I have also discussed the outcomes of past CISE experimentations that my colleagues and I have developed for the automatic annotation of document components in scholarly articles according to particular structural patterns (inline, block, etc.), structural semantics (paragraph, section, figure, etc.), and rhetorical components (i.e. references), as introduced in Section 5. While these do not address all the layers of annotations sketched in Section 3, I think the outcomes described in Section 5 are acceptable pointers for claiming that some level of automatic semantic enhancement of scholarly articles is possible even in the presence of specific constraints such as the independence from the natural language used for writing such articles and the markup language used for storing their contents. Thus CISE provides at least a partial positive answer to the research question presented in Section 1: “Can the purely syntactic organisation of the various parts of a scholarly article convey something about its semantic and rhetorical representation, and to what extent?”. In the future, I plan to perform additional studies and experiments to further validate this claim.
