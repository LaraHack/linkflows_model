Other approaches based on the application of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to a corpus of PDF documents have also been proposed, with the goal of reconstructing the organisation of a document by marking up its most meaningful parts. For instance, in [21], Kim et al. propose an approach based on the OCR recognition of article zones so as to label them with particular categories, such as affiliations, abstract, sections, titles and authors. Similarly, in [38], Taghva et al. use an OCR technique for reconstructing the logical structure of technical documents starting from the information about fonts and geometry of a scanned document.
