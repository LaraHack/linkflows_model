These papers thus propose algorithms based on NLP tools, Machine Learning approaches, and OCR frameworks for annotating the various component parts of a document with specific categories. In contrast, the work I present in this article uses none of these techniques. Rather, it involves a pure Document Engineering analysis of the containment relations between the various document parts, without consideration of any aspect related to the language used to write the document or the markup language used to store it. CISE is thus compatible with and complementary to the aforementioned tools, and in principle each could be used to refine the results of the other. However, exploring these kinds of interactions is beyond the scope of this article.
