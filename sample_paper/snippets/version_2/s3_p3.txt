The graph on the left in Fig. 1 shows a strict application of the principle of compositionality. While it may seem valid from an intuitive perspective, past studies (e.g. [29]33) have proved that the sole application of such principle could not guarantee successful recognition of all the possible interactions existing in a layered system, such as the one that defines the various kinds of meanings possessed by each part of a scholarly article. For instance, it is possible that some semantic annotations of a higher layer can cause the specification of new meanings to a lower layer.
