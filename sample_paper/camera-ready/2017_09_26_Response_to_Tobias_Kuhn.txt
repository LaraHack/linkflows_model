R1: The disregard for any kind of NLP is an important limitation by design, but it is not clear how CISE could be combined with NLP (or, alternatively, why it is beneficial to refrain from NLP altogether)

> It is worth mentioning that I consider CISE compatible and complementary to NLP, Machine Learning, etc. Thus, in principle, NLP tools can be fine-tuned considering the outcomes of CISE and, vice versa, CISE can use inputs derived from NLP mechanisms for improving its outcomes. However, exploring these kinds of interactions is out of scope for the purposes of the article. I've added an explanation at the end of the related works section.

R1: I didn't understand how higher levels effect lower levels by downward causation. The "enviroment" is a crucial part of downward causation (according to the Wikipedia definition), but I didn't understand what this environment is in the case of CISE, and how it allows for this type of effect. Is the environment the entire article, or even the entire socio-technical system? And how does this environment cause the lower layers to change?

> The Wikipedia page describing downward causation says that the environment is fundamentally involved in downward causation in biological systems. However, the generic specification of this causal relationship, as in Campbell 1974, actually refers to the fact that higher levels can cause changes to lower levels – see also http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/DOWNCAUS.html. While the environment can indeed cause changes in biological systems, it is less clear what constitutes the environment for publications, and thus I have explicitly avoided discussion of environmental effects in this article. Thus, since this environmental problem is specific to the Wikipedia article, I decided just to omit reference to the Wikipedia article, and I've defined downward causation in the text as mentioned before.

R1: "who, not necessarily, have authored such works": I think this needs to be rephrased to be proper English.

> Reworded.

R1: Parenthesis not closed: "(25th percentile 34, 75th percentile 175"

> Fixed.

R1: "can the pure syntactic organisation ...": should this be "purely syntactic"?

> Fixed.

R1: "restricting the possible input documents to the sole scholarly articles": I didn't understand what "sole" means in this context.

> “Sole” is wrong in this context. Removed.

R1: The article introduces the term "CISE" twice: in Section 1 and Section 4. I think once is enough.

> Honestly, I would prefer to keep both, since in the first section I just introduce it for the very first time, while in Section 4 I actually explain what it is in detail, and I fear that a reader does not remember properly what does “CISE” mean at that point.

R1: I didn't understand this: "a layer describing a particular conceptualisation of the parts of a scholarly article is dependent somehow on the conceptualisation of at least another lower/higher layer"

> I've slightly rephrased the sentence. The idea is that there is a strict dependency between the layers – i.e. the fact that parts of the annotations in a layer can be derived by means of the annotations defined in other layers.

R1: "continues until new annotations are added or removed from the current set of annotations available": Should this read "... until *no* new annotations are added ..."?

> Yes, indeed. Fixed.

R1: Wouldn't the while loop of Listing 1 stop if the same number of annotations are added and removed? Shouldn't it keep running until no new annotation is added and no annotation is removed (i.e. a fixpoint is reached)?

> Indeed it does. Line 13 is taking care exactly that: it counts the union set of all the annotations that have been added and removed in the last step, and adds the size of this set to the final_annotation variable. Thus any addition/removal of annotations will result in repeating the loop, because in this case the final_annotation number will be incremented.

R1: The fact that rules are applied to *sets* of documents (according to Listing 1) should be explained better. Are such rules therefore supposed to find common patterns across documents?

> I've added an explanation for clarifying this point. In particular, in principle, a rule can process simultaneously more than one document in the input document set, and it could, thus, find common patterns across documents.

R1: "i.e. it is possible to use them, in principle, to write locally/globally incoherent documents": An example might be helpful here.

> I've added an example (Listing 3) that introduces a DocBook document that is not pattern-based.

R1: "(regardless they are pattern-based or not)" > "(regardless of whether they are …"

> Fixed.

R1: I would drop "although they seem reasonable" from this sentence: "Instead, the other conditions introduced in Section 4 are less strict and need a more careful investigation, although they seem reasonable."

> Removed.
