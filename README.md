# linkflows_model
A model for linked workflows together with instantiations

How to model a workflow? What are the possiblities?

1) It is up to the viewer to define it as interconnected activities

2) A fixed sequence where the workflow is a separate node that is connected to activities

3) Have a workflow definition: execution is possible with/without its definition

Workflow definition
* another node in the network, decouple from actual activities that are there
* formally defined, automatically induce the rest; search for what has just happened

Focus on actions that actors perform on a paper, I am not looking at the current set of actions that have already taken place
Past and future in a decentralized manner
Use PROV; the entity can be anything; nodes in the network to be digital ?!
Include computational workflows as well
Which things changed, which review had the biggest impact?

Ontologies in Turtle: define prefixes, declare classes and properties,
domains and ranges, subclasses and subproperties, what you can say about properties
